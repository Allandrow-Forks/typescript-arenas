# It all ends here?

Julius speaks again:

> Congratulations! But it may all end here for you. You must complete this challenge without doing anything. If not, you'll be stuck endlessly repeating the same challenges!

To succeed in this challenge, you simply have to copy and paste the code from the previous challenge and let Julius decide whether you have succeeded or not. If you fail, you will have to restart the arena and learn from your mistakes.
