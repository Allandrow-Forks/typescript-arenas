## Lore

You run your code, and the additions resolve one after another, faster and faster. Just as it becomes impossible to keep track of anything, the sheet bursts into flames and disappears. The teller looks at you with a satisfied expression.

But before you can rejoice in your victory, a guard comes up to you:

> It seems that you are not completely incapable. Follow me.

Without waiting, he turns around and enters the arena. He walks fast, and you have to hurry to keep up. During the journey, you barely have time to observe the surroundings. You notice that the arena is huge, and that you are surrounded by thousands of warriors.

They are all solving challenges. Many of them seem to be struggling to solve the challenges, and some of them are even crying. Others, on the other hand, seem to have a bright smile on their face. They are solving increasingly difficult challenges, and they seem to be having fun. You wonder what lies ahead.

You finally arrive at your destination. The guard takes you into a room. You are now facing a man in his forties. He looks at you with a stern expression.

> Ah, finally some extra arms. Welcome to the kindergarten.

You realise that the room is full of children. They all seem to be busy with a variety of games. Some of them are scribbling on leaves, some of which eventually catch fire. The man lets you watch for a few seconds, then adds:

> All warriors start here. And have to prove that they are at least capable of helping children solve simple problems. You have at least the level of a child, right?

With that, he walks away and leaves you to the mercy of the children.

## Is it bigger?

A group of children seem to have spotted you. They run up to you and start bombarding you with questions:

> Mister, mister, 5 is bigger than 3, right?

> Hey, is 3 bigger than 7?

> Kevinus says that 2 is bigger than 1, but I don't agree!

You try to answer them, but there are too many children. You turn to the man who welcomed you. But he pays you no attention. And more and more children approach. With more and more questions.

You have no choice but to satisfy them.

Write a function `isBigger` that takes two parameters as input and returns a boolean.

Fortunately for you, children are only interested in knowing whether one integer is strictly greater than another.

```ts
export const isBigger = (a: number, b: number): boolean => {

};
```
