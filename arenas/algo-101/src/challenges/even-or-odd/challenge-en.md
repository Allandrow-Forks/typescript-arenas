## Lore

The children are more interested in how you answer their questions with your code than in the answers themselves. Gradually, the children move away, and more magic leaves start to burn by the dozen.

Someone taps you on the shoulder. You turn around and see that it is the man who greeted you.

> Not bad, the new guy. You might be useful here. Come on, time is running out. We have to take them to lunch. I'm Marcus, by the way.

Indeed, you feel like time has flown by. You realise that you spent half the day answering children's questions.

## Even or Odd ?

> Help me. Traditionally, children are lined up in pairs. Those with an even age on the left, those with an odd age on the right. Don't worry, their age is written on their uniform. Otherwise I would already be senile.

On closer inspection, all the children wear a similar uniform, with their name and age written on it. But when Marcus calls for them to be grouped together, you realise that there are even more of them than you thought.

You'll have to be clever if you want to organise them in pairs before the sun goes down!

```ts
export const evenOrOdd = (age: number): 'Even' | 'Odd' => {

};
```
