## Lore

Not without difficulty, you have managed to organise the children in pairs. The children seem to be hungry and eventually stop running around. The journey to the canteen goes smoothly, and the children settle down in groups on an impressive number of tables.

Marcus calls out to you:

> Go to the kitchen, I'll look after the children.

So you go to the kitchen, where you find an army of cooks. One of them greets you:

> Hello, are you the newcomer? Good luck! So, how many mouths to feed today?

You have no idea. There are dozens of them. Hundreds? It's ridiculous that you and Marcus are alone to look after all these children.

## Count them all!

Fortunately, the children are rather quiet and do not move. Everyone stays at their own table, under Marcus' supervision. This is probably your chance. By counting how many children there are at each table, and adding it up, you should be able to give this cook an answer.

You get a list of the number of children per table easily enough. Something like this:

```ts
[6, 3, 9, 2, 12, 4, 6]
```

With this list, you should get the total number of children: 42.

Obviously, the children are much more numerous in real life.

Write a function `sum` that takes as input a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.

```ts
export const sum = (list: number[]): number => {

};
```
