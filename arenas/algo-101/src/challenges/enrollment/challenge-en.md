# Algo 101 - Introduction

Welcome to "Algo 101", the arena where you will become a formidable warrior of algorithms. Here, you will start as a mere novice, solving beginner-level challenges.

But don't worry, the challenges will become increasingly difficult as you progress through the higher levels. You will have to prove yourself by solving more and more complex problems to become the greatest warrior in the history of the arena.

Each victory will allow you to progress, rank up, and unlock new challenges. You will need to use your problem-solving skills and creativity to overcome every obstacle in your path.

So, are you ready to become an algorithm gladiator? Enter the arena of Algo 101 and prove your worth as a coder!

## Lore

You approach the ticket booth of the arena to enroll. The ticket attendant asks you to identify yourself. You show him your papers and he hands you a contract. Excited to become a warrior of algorithms, you sign the contract without even reading it. He then hands you a piece of paper and something to write with.

> Fill this out, and we'll see what we can do with you.

The paper contains a list of additions, all of them simpler than the others. Rather ridiculous as an entrance test. The attendant watches your reaction with a mischievous eye. Before you can say anything, he adds:

> Go and fill this on the table over there. If you can.

As you start to solve the additions by hand, they disappear and are replaced by new, unsolved additions. It seems impossible to fill them all out this way.

Then, you remember why you are here. What if you could solve all these additions at once, almost instantly? Would that work? You brandish your favorite code editor. You're not going to let a piece of paper get the best of you!

## Enrollment

Write a function `add` that takes two parameters as input and returns their sum.

```ts
export const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {

};
```
