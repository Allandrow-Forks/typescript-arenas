Still here?! It seems you are more resilient than you appear.

But don't claim victory too soon. These small rounds are nothing compared to what you will experience in the Arena.

While waiting for the real battles, here is a weapon that may be useful to you: >.

Don't count on me to explain how it works.

The greatest warriors figure it out on their own.

Write a file called throw.sh that writes The warrior throws their knife! into a file called enemy.

Here is an example to help you understand the script's usage:

```shell
$> sh throw.sh
$> cat ./enemy
The warrior throws their knife!
$>
```

I hope you will find this weapon useful.
