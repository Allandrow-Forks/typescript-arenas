Congratulations warrior!

You have overcome the first trap of the Arena.

You now know how to submit your work for Julius' judgment.

It's a good start, but it won't be enough to fight the monsters that await you on this journey.

It's time to learn your first weapon: echo.

It might seem ridiculous.

But when used in the right way, it turns out to be formidable.

Write a shell script called scream.sh that writes I am a warrior! to the standard output.

Here's an example of execution:

```shell
$> sh scream.sh
I am a warrior!
$>
```

Good luck!
