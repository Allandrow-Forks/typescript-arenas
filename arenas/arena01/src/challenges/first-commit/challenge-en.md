Warrior, listen to me, this is important.

The Arena is an exceptional place where you can progress by solving challenges.

Do not get discouraged and pay attention to every detail. Nothing is done by chance.

Other warriors are fighting the same battle as you right now.

Do not hesitate to join them on Discord to maximize your chances.

To complete a round, you must create a submission directory in your repository and include all the required submission files in it.

Finally, you must commit your work.

But be careful, gladiator, the names of the commits are of major importance; we call them smart commits.

Analyze the instructions at your disposal carefully.

With each submission, Julius will perform automated tests.

Julius is not very friendly; if a test fails, you will fail.

Now, I have already told you enough.

Use the `mkdir` command to create the expected directory.

Then add the requested file to it with the `touch` command.

This file will remain empty for now.

Good luck, warrior!
